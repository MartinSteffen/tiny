* Intro


This describes the (currently very rudimentary) code for the ~tiny~ (from
the compiler-construction book of Louden) language in Go. Currently it's
more like playing around with Go and differerent flavors of /visitors/,
nothing really finished.

There is also a version in ~ocaml~ but not here, it's locally
under ~$(HOME)/teaching/compilers/tiny~.





* Structure

   - [[./org]]: organizational remarks, todo's, bug lists 

* Prerequisits





The code should work independent from the go version (not too ancient
though, one would presume.) Currently I assume it's /part/ of a go
/workspace/, it's not a workspace in itself (i.e., there are no ~src~ etc
subdirectories). It's difficul5




#+BEGIN_SRC 
GOROOT=
GOPATH=/home/msteffen/cor/tiny
#+END_SRC




If one had already a go workspace (say under ~$(HOME)/go~), it seem kind of
standard to clone the repos under

#+BEGIN_SRC 
  $(HOME)/go/src/github.com/MartinSteffen/
#+END_SRC

The environment the looked like

#+BEGIN_SRC 
GOROOT=
GOPATH=$(HOME)/go
#+END_SRC

and the import of ~absynt~  would look like

#+BEGIN_SRC  go
import ("github.com/MartinSteffen/tiny/absynt"
#+END_SRC

*** Remote import paths


#+BEGIN_SRC 
  go get github.com/MartinSteffen/tiny/ast 
#+END_SRC



** Remarks 

* Rest 


Sub-directories
---------------

  - ./org      org-mode todo list and issues
  - ./ast      abstract syntax tree data structure + some simple walk through
  - ./test     to play around
