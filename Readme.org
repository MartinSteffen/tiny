* Intro


This describes the (currently very rudimentary) code for the ~tiny~ (from
the compiler-construction book of Louden) language in Go. Currently it's
more like playing around with Go and visitors, nothing really finished.

There is also a version in ~ocaml~ but not here ([[~/teaching/compilers/tiny]]]




* Structure

   - [[./org]]: organizational remarks, todo's, bug lists
