* Intro


This describes the (currently very rudimentary) code for the ~tiny~ (from
the compiler-construction book of Louden) language in Go. Currently it's
more like playing around with Go and differerent flavors of /visitors/,
nothing really finished.

There is also a version in ~ocaml~ but not here, it's locally
under ~$(HOME)/teaching/compilers/tiny~.





* Structure

   - [[./org]]: organizational remarks, todo's, bug lists 


* Prerequisits

  - should work independent of the go version (not too ancient though)

* Rest
