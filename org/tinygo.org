   I would have thought it's

   => It seems to related to the fact that some of the stuff is not

     After changing the type from number to int (which is the same but definitely
     global, I get the error

    It's weird, seems there is some inconsistencies. If I program in

   func main () {

   writing 

   func main () {
  	f :=    &ast.NUMBER{1}
 	fmt.Println(f)
	
   }

   then the compiler complains that he cannot figure out the arg.

   Perhaps that's because the package name etc are not yet fully clarified
   and it does not find the "ast"

*** TODO analyze the other visitor <2015-07-17 Fri 15:07>


The following seems a bit different. It also has a ``visit'' function and
an ``accept'' function. It seems that one difference is: perhaps the
ast-visitor was special isofar there was ``direct'' recursion.  But maybe
not. Anyhow

#+begin_example
 
type CarPart interface {   // CarPart not= CarPartVisitor
    Accept(CarPartVisitor) 
}

#+end_example

 


#+begin_example

type CarPartVisitor interface {
    visitWheel(wheel *Wheel)
    visitEngine(engine *Engine)
}

*** TODO make a visitor <2015-07-17 Fri 09:32>
**** TODO can one make a less flat visitor <2015-07-17 Fri 09:33>

     The visitor of go is flat.  My recursive function was not. So, I would
     like a similar design here.

     In my file, there's a function there Print_<nonterminal> for all of
     those. Probably, there'd b a visitor for all of those =>
     
     Let's make a visitor for all Print_X.

     That would probably mean whe need a visitor interface for all the
     phrases.


**** TODO add a visitor for staments <2015-07-17 Fri 09:59>


     What is uncear is how to escape to the other clauses. We have to see about that
     
     Why I need is an visitor, that's done with make(visitor)



**** TODO Analyze the Visitor in the go compiler <2015-07-17 Fri 13:16>

The visitor is contained in the ast-package (in the ast-directory). The
code is mainly defined in walk.go.  But it's used in a different
package. It's not clear if that is officially a visitor. One ingredient
seems missing at least if one compares it to the visitor pattern as known,
namely there is no accept method: typically, the data structure being
visited has such a method, but the ast here does not. It could however be
that one may use the word ``visitor'' more loosely, as any form of
higher-order function that allows to iterate here through an inductively
defined data structure, here the ast.

#+begin_example

type Visitor interface {
	Visit (stmt Node) (w Visitor)   
}
     
#+end_example

The Node is the catch-all type for all nodes of the ast (i.e., it is
embedded into all the more concrete nodes).


 What's strange he is also how it is later used, namely in the following
form (at the beginning of the Walk, function):


#+begin_example

func Walk(v Visitor, node Node) {
	if v = v.Visit(node); v == nil {
		return
	}

        ...

#+end_example


See also the ``client'' code. There are two things to do: define the
visitor, and then using it, by passing it to the Walk function. In order to
be a visitor, it must satisfy the Visitor interface. The only thing
required there is to implement the accept method (here Visit). So it's the
combination of both the data type plus the Visit-method that makes it to a
visitor.


#+begin_example

type visitor chan *ast.Ident   

func (v visitor) Visit(n ast.Node) (w ast.Visitor) {
	if ident, ok := n.(*ast.Ident); ok {  // ``special assignment'' for type assertion, ok is a boolean
		v <- ident  // send to channel v
	}
	return v
}


#+end_example


Note that the visitor is not even a struct, it's a channel (but I don't
know what all is allowed). But indeed, it's some reference type that
supports the Visit function. Also the receiver type, the argument type and
the return type are as requested by the Visitor interface. This
``function'' (represented by the visitor-references is of type

  Visitor .-> Node -> Visitor


The syntax of the if-statement is not too transparent. the "<-" syntax can
mean send or receive. But since on the left hand side there's a channel,
it's send.  Now, ast.Ident is just one kind of node, and n.(*ast.Ident) is
a type assertion. However, it's a ``special'' one because it's used in a
special kind of assignment. In this case, not panic occurs.


#+begin_example

func idents(f *ast.File) <-chan *ast.Ident {
	v := make(visitor)   // due to the above method, this results in a Visitor
	go func() {
		ast.Walk(v, f)    
		close(v)
	}()
	return v
}

#+end_example     


- First the interface: The "interface { ... }" is an interface type, the
  whole thing is a type declaration.  Inside the braces it the method
  specification. [It's a bit unclear why we can leave out ";" but ok]. The
  next one is the method name Accept, and  the signature    

                (stmt Stmt) (w Visitor)  

  https://golang.org/ref/spec#Signature

  This one is more stricky. The signature is of one of two forms:
  Parameters or Parameters Results. The signatures are described in
  connection with function types (there are examples). Even if not really
  explaned, the Visitor is the return type.

     https://gist.github.com/francoishill/f0624e7760aacdc96b42

     They use more standard "terminology", what's called "Visit" here is
     called "Accept" there. It's not really an inductive structure, but
     ok. They don't deal with channels.

     node: Node. The node is the top-``ìnterface''

     In the ast.go, there are a few comments like

	Type   Expr      // asserted type; nil means type switch X.(type)
   so probably that is a general go language thing.


   Anyway, it's a special form (or variant) of a type assertion. It's a
   type switch. It's indeed used om a big switch-case.

     It uses a type switch switch n := node.(type). That gives various
     cases. It seems that the case-switch structure is flat , despite the
     fact that there are substructures of Node.

     It seems that this is _not_ fixed. It seems that n is just the node
     which is represented by n. That can be seen in walk.go by looking at
     the different cases in the case switch. Depending on the case, one
     makes use of things like n.Doc or n.Low. For instance, in case n is of
     type *Field (i.e., a reference to a Field): the type Field is a
     struct, i.e., a struct type (or record type).  Now, fields are structs
     which have a ``field'' like Doc. In a functional language, it's like

     Field of CommentGroup *  Ident *  Expr * BasicLit * CommentGoup (1)

    If of course not a tuple but a record, but ok.

     That one is a Node. Let's ignore the sub-structures, because they
     don't play a role, probably in the switching. Anyhow: the particular
     node constructed via Field has 5 args, as given above in (1). In ms, they would be matched like

     match n with
       Field(c1,i,e.b.c2) -> 

    which means the names are given locally. In the kind of programming here it's with 
    selectors like

      n.Doc 


      depending on the type switch case, different selectors apply of course.

     One may see that for instance for Field: it's a struct type, and has a
     number of fields. That seems to me like describing the result of
     applying a constructor. The question then is how to do that?

     I guess, one may simply write some functions, or better methods.

     I'd actually expect that a parser should have some such
     functions/methods, one should check there ->
     
     yes.

** Go language questions

   See also the go.org file

*** TODO how is the AST of go designed <2015-07-13 Mon 13:05>
    
    Probably they use structural subtyping. There are 4 important
    interfaces. Probably one can illustrate it as follows:

    
                   Node
                /   |    \
	    Exp    Stmt  Decl

 
The language is probably readable at

   https://golang.org/ref/spec     


For instance for the statements

Statement =
	Declaration | LabeledStmt | SimpleStmt |
	GoStmt | ReturnStmt | BreakStmt | ContinueStmt | GotoStmt |
	FallthroughStmt | Block | IfStmt | SwitchStmt | SelectStmt | ForStmt |
	DeferStmt .

SimpleStmt = EmptyStmt | ExpressionStmt | SendStmt | IncDecStmt | Assignment | ShortVarDecl .


That does not 100% correspond to what one sees in the implementation. I
would rather like to come up with a scheme, which is more or less schematic
_AND_ corresponds 100% to the grammar. We should have a look at 2 things,
the grammar _and_ the ML ast. I guess the better starting point is the
ast. That should very much determine the tree, because it's a tree.

    There seem to be a kind of visitor pattern in the go-implementation
    itself. One question is why that is necessary at all. Because we have
    those external methods. Those seem to allow to do what a visitor can do
    (don't know about extensibility). Therefore: just implement one simple
    one.

    It seems to not be  immediately possible.    If I do that, it gives
