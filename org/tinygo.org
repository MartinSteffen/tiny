** Misc (later more structure)





*** TODO Analyze the visitor in the go compiler <2015-07-17 Fri 13:16>

The visitor is contained in the ast-package (in the ast-directory). The
code is mainly defined in walk.go.  But it's used in a different
package. It's not clear if that is officially a visitor. One ingredient
seems missing, at least if one compares it to the visitor pattern as known,
namely there is no accept method: typically, the data structure being
visited has such a method, but the ast here does not. It could however be
that one may use the word ``visitor'' more loosely, as any form of
higher-order function that allows to iterate here through an inductively
defined data structure, here the ast, any form of ``fold'' function.

#+begin_example

type Visitor interface {
	Visit (stmt Node) (w Visitor)   
}
     
#+end_example

The Node is the catch-all type for all nodes of the ast (i.e., it is
embedded into all the more concrete nodes). A difference to the visitor
discussed next is that 


 What's strange he is also how it is later used, namely in the following
form (at the beginning of the Walk, function):


#+begin_example

func Walk(v Visitor, node Node) {
	if v = v.Visit(node); v == nil {
		return
	}

        ...

#+end_example


See also the ``client'' code. There are two things to do: define the
visitor, and then using it, by passing it to the Walk function. In order to
be a visitor, it must satisfy the Visitor interface. The only thing
required there is to implement the accept method (here Visit). So it's the
combination of both the data type plus the Visit-method that makes it to a
visitor.


#+begin_example

type visitor chan *ast.Ident   

func (v visitor) Visit(n ast.Node) (w ast.Visitor) {
	if ident, ok := n.(*ast.Ident); ok {  // ``special assignment'' for type assertion, ok is a boolean
		v <- ident  // send to channel v
	}
	return v
}


#+end_example


Note that the visitor is not even a struct, it's a channel (but I don't
know what all is allowed). But indeed, it's some reference type that
supports the Visit function. Also the receiver type, the argument type and
the return type are as requested by the Visitor interface. This
``function'' (represented by the visitor-references is of type

  Visitor .-> Node -> Visitor


The syntax of the if-statement is not too transparent. the "<-" syntax can
mean send or receive. But since on the left hand side there's a channel,
it's send.  Now, ast.Ident is just one kind of node, and n.(*ast.Ident) is
a type assertion. However, it's a ``special'' one because it's used in a
special kind of assignment. In this case, not panic occurs.


#+begin_example

func idents(f *ast.File) <-chan *ast.Ident {
	v := make(visitor)   // due to the above method, this results in a Visitor
	go func() {
		ast.Walk(v, f)    
		close(v)
	}()
	return v
}

#+end_example     


- First the interface: The "interface { ... }" is an interface type, the
  whole thing is a type declaration.  Inside the braces it the method
  specification. [It's a bit unclear why we can leave out ";" but ok]. The
  next one is the method name Accept, and  the signature    

                (stmt Stmt) (w Visitor)  

  https://golang.org/ref/spec#Signature

  This one is more stricky. The signature is of one of two forms:
  Parameters or Parameters Results. The signatures are described in
  connection with function types (there are examples). Even if not really
  explaned, the Visitor is the return type.
  

  






*** TODO Analyze the ``Car'' visitor <2015-07-17 Fri 15:07>

The following is an analysis of the code found at
https://gist.github.com/f0624e7760aacdc96b42.git. The structure is a bit
different, in particular the data structure being visited (see for instance
the interface ~CarPart~ below) supports an accept-function (which is
``standard''). One distiguishes best between the code for the data
structures (including the infrastructure to support ``visitors'') and the
client code, that makes use of the stuff, i.e., that provides a /concrete/
data structure, a /concrete/ visitor (and let it run).

**** Data structures

Let's start with the data structure itself, the car parts: 

#+begin_example
type CarPart interface {   
    Accept(CarPartVisitor) 
}
#+end_example


The data structure is /abstract/, just an interface. Crucial is the
presence of an accept-method, that accepts the corresponding visitor, with
the following  interface ~CarPartVisitor~:


#+begin_example
type CarPartVisitor interface {
    visitWheel(wheel *Wheel)
    visitEngine(engine *Engine)
}
#+end_example


The correspondent type in the ast of before is the ~Visitor~
interface. There are a number of differences, though. First, the
~CarPartVisitor~ interface requires /two/ visit-functions.  The intention
is (indicated also by its name) that the ~CarPartVisitor~ is used to
``visit'' car parts. However, car parts is only an interface, as well,
i.e., it's abstract. Therefore, what is /concretely/ to be visited are
instances of the ``sub-classes'' of ~CarPart~. Of course, there's no
subclassing here. What matters is elements that match the ~CarPart~
interface:

So, that is the classic visitor structure: The data structure supports an
accept function which takes the visitor as argument, and in term the
visitor has a visit-function, which takes data-structures as argument,
i.e., here ~CarPart~'s. Being abstract, the visit-function is /split/ into
two cases, handling concrete car parts. Perhaps that is a (small) price to
pay for the absence of /method overloading/ that we one has to choose two
differnent names for the two visit-functions. With this kind of
overloading, one might have gotten away with just calling both just ~visit~.

Now, as mentioned, with duck typing (and the ~CarPart~-interface given as
is) car parts are /defined/ as those elements which accept a car-part
visitor!  That would some stucts, namely cars, engines, and wheels

#+begin_example
//------------------------- car part: wheel ---------
 type Wheel struct {
    Name string
}
 
func (this *Wheel) Accept(visitor CarPartVisitor) {
    visitor.visitWheel(this)   ``function application'' via call-back
}

//------------------------- car part: engine ---------

type Engine struct {}
 
func (this *Engine) Accept(visitor CarPartVisitor) {
    visitor.visitEngine(this)   // ``function application'' via call-back
}
 
//------------------------- car part: car ---------
type Car struct {
    parts []CarPart
}
 
func NewCar() *Car {
    this := new(Car)
    this.parts = []CarPart{
        &Wheel{"front left"},
        &Wheel{"front right"},
        &Wheel{"rear right"},
        &Wheel{"rear left"},
        &Engine{}}
    return this
}
 
func (this *Car) Accept(visitor CarPartVisitor) {
    for _, part := range this.parts {
        part.Accept(visitor)
    }
}
 
#+end_example

Note that, as requested by the car part interface, the car parts must
support the ~Accept~ method. That means, the data structures themselves
must be ``changed'' to support the visitor pattern. In go, the method can
be externally ``attached'' to the data structure, but due to scope
restriction, one cannot add those methods from outside a given package
(maybe not even outside a file).


A side remark on the design: as mentioned above, the ~CarPartVisitor~
support visit functions for two concrete car parts, namely wheels and
engines, and they are called differently. I think a different design would
be possible two, using only one single ~visit~-function, with then the
/abstract/ ~CarPart~ as type of the parameter, not the concrete struct
types. If doing so, the ``dispatch'' to the different cases needs to by one
inside (i.e., at the start) of the body of that method. That would be done
/switching/ on the different options (with the help of the special form of
/type assertions/, like ~y := cp.(type)~). It would be a way of achieving
the same --dispatch on the type argument-- as with method overloading
(which we don't have in go) except that we'd actually had only one
~visit~-method.

Note finally: there are /three/ concrete types (i.e., record types) which
are car parts (namely those which support the accept method), wheels,
engines, but also cars themselves. However, the visitor ~CarPartVisitor~
covers only the wheels and the engine. The reason is: one ~Car~ already has
a kind of ``visitor'' functionality in the following sense: the car
basically a ``list'' of car-parts (as a slice). For slices, there is
already an official iteration pattern, the for-loop in connection with the
range-construct. So, this part of the data structure is ``iterated over''
not with the ``visit/accept'' pattern. Besides that: it is not really clean
design that cars are also car part (no just because in ``real life'' it
sounds strange). In an inductive definition or in a functional language,
the type of cars would not be ``merged'' with that of its parts.

**** Client code

So far everything was abstact, we have some infrastructure to run a
``fold''.  So we need to declare / define a concrete struct implementing
the visitor (the struct is declared, but the methods, attached to it, are
defined).


#+begin_example
type GetMessageVisitor struct{
    Messages []string
}
 
func (this *GetMessageVisitor) visitWheel(wheel *Wheel) {
    this.Messages = append(this.Messages, fmt.Sprintf("Visiting the %v wheel\n", wheel.Name))
}
 
func (this *GetMessageVisitor) visitEngine(engine *Engine) {
    this.Messages = append(this.Messages, fmt.Sprintf("Visiting engine\n"))
}

#+end_example


#+begin_example
func main() {
    car := NewCar()
    visitor := new(GetMessageVisitor)
    car.Accept(visitor)
    fmt.Println(visitor.Messages)
}

#+end_example

**** An equivalent functional data structure

The above structure is rather clumsy when compared to functional
representation with higher-order functions and pattern matching. The
example is also slightly too simple. The visitors are used in particular
also to iterate through a /recursive/ or /inductively given/ data
structures. The parts of a car here are not recursive. The only recursive
part is the fact that cars have a field implemented as slice (of car
parts). In connection with that: the fact that cars are also car parts
would allow that cars could contains cars as parts, which would add an
element of recursive definition here. But that's not intended,
pragmatically at least. So the only recursive part here, which is the
slice, is not actually solved following the accept/visit-structure of the
visitor pattern. Instead, the slice is iterated over using the for-loop in
connection with the range-construct. Anyhow, the data type in a
functional/inductive representation looks as follows, where I use list as
replacement for the slice in go:

#+begin_example
   type carpart = 
     | Engine of unit 
     | Wheel of string


   type car = carpart list  
#+end_example

Unlike the representation in the go code, ~car~ here is not at the same
time a ~carpart~. If one wanted a 100% correspondence, one had to make the
two type definition mutually recursive, but it is clearly not what the
example is intended to model.

     :END:

As explained, there are three concrete car parts, but car part visitor has
only 2 two methods, i.e., it can only react to two of them (engines and
wheels, but not cars). It's because the car (which is strangely also a car
part), is nothing else than a ``list'' in the form of a slice. A visitor is
supposed to iterate through that thing. But 1) a slice is not a car part
insofar it does not support an ``accept'' method (but cars
do). Furthermore, 2) there is an official way to iterate through a slice,
that's the for-loop in connection with the range-construct. That's what's
done here.

       we are given

         stmt ::= IF exp ....

       so IF must accept a Stmt_Visitor.
       
       This is what we have done anyway: the IF constuctor is a statement 
       and therefore accepts a StmtVisitor. The problem starts with 
       its first component, the expression. expressions are not of
       type statement. Therefore they also don't support a visit_Exp.

       note: of course: if the first component of the IF were a stmt
       we could also not just do

         visitor.visit_stmt(this)

      we simply don't have those functions.

      Probably, we need a generic visitor 



That does not work
type Visitor interface {     // new attempt
	visit_Stmt (s Stmt)  // just a dispatch
	visit_Expr (e Expr)  // just a dispatch
}

func (s *Stmt) visit_Stmt () {}
func (s *Expr) visit_Expr () {}


****** TODO why not manke Visitor a super-interface? <2015-07-18 Sat 16:10>
       I guess that might work, the question is, does it fit with duck typing

       The problem also is: everything works fine with concrete stuff
       gluing stuff to

       IF / WhEN so visit_IF is ok, but not visit_Expr because Expr is not a struct. 
       We cannot glue anything to Exp.

     It seems that this is _not_ fixed. It seems that n is just the node
     which is represented by n. That can be seen in walk.go by looking at
     the different cases in the case switch. Depending on the case, one
     makes use of things like n.Doc or n.Low. For instance, in case n is of
     type *Field (i.e., a reference to a Field): the type Field is a
     struct, i.e., a struct type (or record type).  Now, fields are structs
     which have a ``field'' like Doc. In a functional language, it's like

     Field of CommentGroup *  Ident *  Expr * BasicLit * CommentGoup (1)

    If of course not a tuple but a record, but ok.

     That one is a Node. Let's ignore the sub-structures, because they
     don't play a role, probably in the switching. Anyhow: the particular
     node constructed via Field has 5 args, as given above in (1). In ms, they would be matched like

     match n with
       Field(c1,i,e.b.c2) -> 

    which means the names are given locally. In the kind of programming here it's with 
    selectors like

      n.Doc 


      depending on the type switch case, different selectors apply of course.

** Go language questions

   See also the go.org file

*** TODO how is the AST of go designed <2015-07-13 Mon 13:05>
    
    Probably they use structural subtyping. There are 4 important
    interfaces. Probably one can illustrate it as follows:

    
                   Node
                /   |    \
	    Exp    Stmt  Decl

 
The language is probably readable at

   https://golang.org/ref/spec     


For instance for the statements

Statement =
	Declaration | LabeledStmt | SimpleStmt |
	GoStmt | ReturnStmt | BreakStmt | ContinueStmt | GotoStmt |
	FallthroughStmt | Block | IfStmt | SwitchStmt | SelectStmt | ForStmt |
	DeferStmt .

SimpleStmt = EmptyStmt | ExpressionStmt | SendStmt | IncDecStmt | Assignment | ShortVarDecl .


That does not 100% correspond to what one sees in the implementation. I
would rather like to come up with a scheme, which is more or less schematic
_AND_ corresponds 100% to the grammar. We should have a look at 2 things,
the grammar _and_ the ML ast. I guess the better starting point is the
ast. That should very much determine the tree, because it's a tree.

    There seem to be a kind of visitor pattern in the go-implementation
    itself. One question is why that is necessary at all. Because we have
    those external methods. Those seem to allow to do what a visitor can do
    (don't know about extensibility). Therefore: just implement one simple
    one.

    It seems to not be  immediately possible.    If I do that, it gives


      ./somename.go:28: cannot define new methods on non-local type ast.FACTOR

    ``The base type must not be a pointer or interface type and must be
     declared in the same package as the method.''

     Seems like not possible.


     In some discussion there is some mention of ``embedding''



    type MyExtension struct {
        otherPackage.Type
    }  


    func (me *MyExtension) NewMethod() { ... }



    Functions are easier
